<h4>Stock control cards that you can update centrally or on site</h4>

<p>The system produces a QR code image that can then be printed on a label of physical stock card. The information is then readable using a mobile smart-phone. Create and update stock information either centrally or at the location of the stock. Because tags can be encapsulated and even read from behind glass or at a distance, they are suitable for environments where paper cards and hand writing would not be practical.  </p>
<p>We even have a two-card free subscription to get you going.</p>
