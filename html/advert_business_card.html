<p>Publish your contact details and marketing or information message in an easily viewable, and actionable QR code designed for mobile phones.</p>
<p>The unique benefit of Q-Action is that you can update the details at any time, change them temporarily while you are on holiday, or if your personnel change then you can change the card to show to a new contact for that role. You can put your QR code tag on the side of a van, on a poster, exhibition stand, label or leaflet. We even have a free subscription to get you going.</p>
