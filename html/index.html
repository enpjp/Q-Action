<h2>Web pages for people on the move</h2>


<p>QR codes connect the physical world to mobile phones. They are a kind of pixel-based &quot;square bar code&quot; that is readable by the camera in most smart phones and tablet PCs and take you to a web page. What&#39;s special about Q-Action is that while the printed code is fixed, the page it shows is up-datable and re-configurable. Q-Action pages can give you: </p>
<ul>
<li>Electronic business cards and leaflets that never go out of date</li>
<li>Mini web sites that you mange from your mobile</li>
<li>Electronic posters for nearby services, showing current offers</li>
<li>Dynamic codes that can point to different web sites at different times</li>
<li>Shop window offers with a &quot;buy now&quot; facility for window shoppers and out of hours sales</li>
<li>Everlasting membership cards that always show the member&#39;s current status</li>
<li>Warranty and service cards with up-datable product and installation info</li>
<li>Stock control cards that you can update centrally or on location</li>
<li>Emergency advice notices, contact information, and nearest help</li>
<li>Rota lists that show who or what is available today</li>
<li>Up-to-the-minute live programme guides for events and shows</li>
<li>Location pages that show what&#39;s currently open and what&#39;s closed</li>
<li>All the other ideas we haven&#39;t thought of but you will</li>
</ul>

<p>You control your Q-Action pages from any browser. Users scan your printed tag using any standard QR code reader app. They can then take immediate action - browse, buy, visit, call, or just read and learn. Q-Action pages join the physical world to mobile media.</p>
