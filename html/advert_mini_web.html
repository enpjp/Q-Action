<p>The Q-Action Mini-Web site enables you to create a simple mobile-friendly web site of a home page and up to 10 sub-pages accessed through navigation buttons. No programming necessary, and you can set the whole thing up from your mobile phone. </p>
<p>The home page contains your welcome and introduction message, while the other pages can be built from any of your other Q-Action pages. You can even set your buttons up to point to your photo and video galleries hosted on sites like Flickr, Vimeo, and YouTube to create a rich multi-media site on a shoe-string budget.</p>
<p> Open up your imagination and build your web presence from your smart phone! We even have a free subscription to get you going.</p>
