<h4>Bringing places alive with knowledge and information</h4>

<p>Guided tour pages enable you to provide basic visitor information which the tourist accesses using their mobile phone. Each page can relate to a specific location and is easily updated as visitor information changes, including features and locations that are temporarily closed. </p>
<p>As well as simple tour pages there are a other page types that can be used as part of a guided tour and you can even link to on-line resources for photographs, audio and video. We have a free subscription so you can create a couple of pages at no cost.</p>
